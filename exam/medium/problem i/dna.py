This problem is in "Normal" group

You are researching different DNAs. DNA is a sequence of nucleotides.
There are 4 types of nucleotides in DNA: cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T].

During your previous experiment you found out that you should not consider DNAs which contain at least 3 Adenine
nucleotides [A] in a row.

Now you want to calculate amount of different DNAs of N nucleotides which you still need to consider.
(Don't think about complementary sequence, just ignore complementarity rules).

Input format
Input file contains single integer number 0 < N â‰¤ 30.

Output format
Print single integer number: number of DNAs consisting of N nucleotides which doesn't have 3 As in a row.
